The BlueZ stack will keep a connection to the device open even if Python exits.
This wrapper "automatically" adds an atexit close of the connection, as well as
trying to remove that atexit command if the object's __del__ method gets called.

There is only a handful of these at any one time. Using the atexit handler
with unique calls for each should be sufficient, rather than managing a list.
