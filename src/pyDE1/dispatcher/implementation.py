"""
How this works:

http/run.py creates an APIRequest and adds it to the queue

The _request_queue_processor from dispatcher picks it up and calls
GET:        resource_dict = await get_resource_to_dict(got.resource)
PATCH, PUT: await patch_resource_from_dict(got.resource, got.payload)

The resource_dict becomes a payload for the APIResponse object that is queued

To be able to return meaningful results from PUT/PATCH, the recipient 
needs to know which of possibly many elements the result comes from.
As most won't be returning anything, at least right now, append each,
within a nested dict, to a list and pass that back.

2022-12
=======

Any time a PATCH or PUT (state-modifying request) is processed, 
an MQTT packet is sent out with the content of the impacted area.

At this time those areas include:
    * de1/profile/id
    * de1/control
    * de1/setting
    * de1/calibration
    
The retain flag was considered for these, but has not been added
as the broker might be down or have been down, so a retained packet
may not be available or may not represent current state.
